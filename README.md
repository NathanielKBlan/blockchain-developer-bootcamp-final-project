# LeadChain
A salesforce app to track leads/opportunities and recommend leads to prioritize

# Need
Throughout life (either personal or professional) we are presented with a wide variety of opportunities.
Each opportunity (or lead) gives us a chance at furthering our own goals, however it is also good to note that
because an opportunity presents itself, it doesn't mean that we always take it. This is because we subconciously
know that each lead caries a cost, be it monetary, time, or even the chance to pursue another lead. Consiously 
though we also consider the potential benefits of pursuing a lead, such as (but not limited to): monetary benefits,
social benefits, potential to generate further leads, etc. More often than not however we can either loose track of
our leads (especially when working solo or with a small team), forget about some, or be indecisive about what lead
to persue. Salesforce already does a great job at providing tools to track leads, but LeadChain goes one step further
and provides robustness, security, and recommendations when it comes to leads.

It really comes down to a simple checklist, such as this one:
